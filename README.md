# FramewIRC

An IRC framework built upon Python 3's asyncio module.

Still immature, but a good foundation (I think).

Focuses on allowing the developer to pick only as much of the stack as required.


## Installation

```bash
pip install framewirc
```


## Quickstart

Here's a simple bot. Let's call it "snarkbot". Whenever it hears a particular
phrase, it responds with a gif.

It probably gets old rather quickly. (I think I may be writing autobiographical
documentation.)

```python
import asyncio

from framewirc import filters, parsers
from framewirc.client import Client
from framewirc.commands import PRIVMSG
from framewirc.handlers import basic_handlers
from framewirc.strings import to_unicode


quips = {
    'shame': 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meshy/gifs/master/shame-bell.gif',
    'YOLO': 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meshy/gifs/master/who-said-yolo.gif',
}


@filters.allow(PRIVMSG)
@parsers.apply_message_parser(parsers.privmsg)
def snarky_response(client, channel, raw_body, **kwargs):
    body = to_unicode(raw_body)

    for trigger, riposte in quips.items():
        if trigger in body:
            client.privmsg(channel, riposte)


class SnarkyClient(Client):
    handlers = basic_handlers + (snarky_response,)
    nick = 'snarkbot'
    real_name = 'framewirc bot'


SnarkyClient().connect_to('irc.example.com')
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
```


## Concepts

Unfortunately, there's no ["One True Way"][xkcd-standards] when it comes to
IRC. Many networks and servers have their own way of doing things that are not
entirely compatible with others. There's nothing wrong with this, exactly, but
it does mean that until this library is a little more mature, it might not
correctly deal with all these eccentricities. If you find an issue that is not
correctly dealt with, please [log an issue on github][github-issues].


### IRC message format

It's probably useful to have some idea of how the IRC protocol works. All
messages in both directions must adhere to the (simple) rules:

- Messages are represented as bytes.

  There is no default encoding, so sometimes one just has to guess! To guess
  how to turn these streams of bytes into Python strings, we have elected to
  use [`cChardet`][cchardet-home] in `strings.to_unicode` when utf8 fails. If
  you know the encoding, you can override this behaviour.

- Messages have a relatively simple structure.

  Generally, a message can be seen to have four distinct parts: a prefix, a
  command, a number of parameters, and a suffix. The parts that are required
  depend on the command. Only the command is always required. This is the
  structure of a message:

  ```
  :colon-indicated-prefix COMMAND some parameters :Suffix following the colon
  ```

  We represent the messages that come from the network with our own subclass of
  `bytes` called `ReceivedMessage`. It has `prefix`, `command`, `parameters`,
  and `suffix` added for convinience. The `prefix` and `command` parts are
  represented as unicode strings, `parameters`is a tuple of unicode strings,
  but `suffix` is a bytestring. This allows for custom logic in decoding
  arbitrary text from the network.

- Messages have a maximum length of 512 bytes.

  This means that when we want to send something longer to the network, we have
  to split it up into smaller chunks. This can be done using
  `messages.chunk_message`.


### Connecting

To connect to an IRC network, create a `Client` object, and call its
`connect_to` method to join the network of your choice. This creates a
`Connection`, and an `asyncio.Task` that will be invoked in the event loop. The
`Client` will be responsible for sending a nick and real name once it has.

If there are any actions that need to be completed on connection, this is
probably the time to do it. The `Client.on_connect` method can be overridden to
add things like connecting to particular rooms, or sending a password to an
authentication bot. (Don't forget to call `super` though!)


### Handling commands from the network

When the `Connection` receives a message, the `Client` will send that message
(and itself) to every one of its `handlers` in turn. This allows them to make a
decision about how they will deal with the message.

As most of your handlers will not need to deal with every message that comes
in, we can remove the boilerplate of `if message.command == MYCOMMAND` through
use of the decorators in the `filters` module. The `allow` filter only allows
messages through to the handler that are in its whitelist. The `deny` filter
does the opposite. eg:

```python
# Rather than this:
def my_command_handler(client, message):
    if message.command != MYCOMMAND:
        return
    do_useful_logic(message)

# It's nicer to have this:
@allow(MYCOMMAND)
def my_simpler_command_handler(client, message):
    do_useful_logic(message)
```


### Sending commands to the network

The `Client` has a couple of helper methods for sending commands to the
network. You can send messages to users or channels with `Client.privmsg()`,
and change your nick with `Client.set_nick()`. As there are a number of other
very common actions, expect this part of the API to change and expand.

To send other messages to the network, you need to construct an appropriate
byte string, and pass it to `Connection.send`. You will probably not want to do
this by hand, so use the `messages.build_message` method to help you.


## Still to come

Features that I am hoping to implement in future:

- More message parsers

  At the moment, we only have a special parser for `PRIVMSG` messages, but
  there is room for loads more.

- Handle more text encodings.

  At the moment, the `to_unicode` method is a little prone to errors when
  `cChardet` provides a [non standard encoding][cchardet-issue-13].

- Find a nicely overridable way to remove the `basic_handlers` boilerplate from
  `Client` subclasses that still allows ways to customise the behaviour.

- Full API documentation.

  I would really like to document the full API, not just the basics. I'd also
  like to explain my rationale for the design decisions I took, and how the
  library contrasts to what is currently available elsewhere.
